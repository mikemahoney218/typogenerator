## Overview

This package is an R implementation of the Golang
[Typogenerator](https://github.com/zntrio/typogenerator) library, incorporating
several methods for creating typos from a set of input strings.

All of these methods work on character vectors of any length and have a standard
interface via the `typo_*` functions:

```{r}
library(typogenerator)

typo_hyphenation("lip")

typo_transposition(c("cats", "dogs"))
```

In addition, generating typos via multiple methods can be done easily using the
`generate_typos` function:

```{r}
generate_typos("snow", c("typo_addition", "typo_prefix"))
```

By default, these functions will only use characters already inside of the word
or which are generally accepted as file names on English-based systems, but 
users can define their own character options by passing vectors to the `chars` 
arguments of each function.

Note that this package is in very early development and the user-facing API is 
liable to change.

## Installation
